FiSHLiM is an XChat plugin for FiSH IRC encryption. It's my attempt at making
a simple, lightweight and secure plugin for this encryption protocol.

For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.


Features
--------

Working:
  * Sending/receiving messages
  * Topic decryption
  * Using unecrypted keys / keys without a password from blow.ini
  * Pure protocol-level filtering (works with highlighting, nick coloring etc)
  * Partially encrypted messages (i.e. prefixed with nickname by a bouncer)

Not working:
  * Key exchange
  * Password-protected key storage
  * Topic encryption
  * Remote exploitation (hopefully!)
  * Plaintext content that contain +OK is decrypted twice


Commands
--------

/setkey  [nick or #channel]  password

    Sets the encryption key for the nick or channel to password. The keys
    are stored in the configuration file in ~/.xchat2/blow.ini


/delkey  nick-or-#channel

    Deletes the given nick or channel from the configuration file.
